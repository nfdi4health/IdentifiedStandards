# Abstract
NFDI4Health focuses on research data management deficits in health and aims to foster and develop harmonized standards for clinical trials, public health and epidemiological studies as well as to facilitate the access to and availability of relevant standards. The following publication aims to provide a non-exhaustive and non-precluding list of syntactic and semantic standards potentially useful for NFDI4Health and beyond. The list was created based on a literature review, expert opinion and the searches in community-driven portals such as FAIRsharing, BioPortal and EMBL-EBI Ontology Lookup Service (short: OLS Ontology Search) as well as the website of ISO. This study focuses on the standardization of health data access and interoperability while ensuring the compatibility of NFDI4Health and specifically of its defined use cases, with existing (inter-)national efforts to guarantee data interoperability in medicine and healthcare. The goal is to foster the collaborative and inter-sectoral work in health research and initiate a debate around the potential of using common standards.
