# Abstract
The German initiative “National Research Data Infrastructure for Personal Health Data” (NFDI4Health) focuses on research data management aspects in health research. Among other goals, it aims to foster and develop harmonized informatics standards for clinical trials, public health and epidemiological studies and to facilitate the access to and availability of relevant data and metadata standards. This publication provides a non-exhaustive list of syntactic and semantic data standards of potential use for NFDI4Health and beyond. The list was created based on interdisciplinary meetings, interviews, literature reviews and searches in community-driven portals such as FAIRsharing, BioPortal, and EMBL-EBI Ontology Lookup Service (short: OLS Ontology Search) as well as the website of ISO. This work focuses on the utilization of standards for health research data ensuring interoperability as well as the compatibility to NFDI4Health, its use cases, and to (inter-)national efforts within medicine and healthcare. The goal is to foster collaborative and inter-sectoral work in health research and initiate a debate around the potential of using common standards.
